This problem asks to do some operations on the median 2k values among 2n numbers. 

The source code is in A4\_P2\_121090642.cpp

This question is easy to solve. We can maintain two heaps to do it. The two heaps are big-top heap and small-top heap. If we can let all the big-top heap's element smaller than the top of the small-top heap, and the numbers are uniformly divided into these two heaps, then we can get the 2k median numbers and do the insertion and deletion efficiently.

Each time we insert, we maintain the numbers in two heaps are equal or the number of big-top heap is bigger than the small-top heap at most 1. The time compelixity for such insertion is $O(lgN)$, because the insertion for the heap is $O(lgN)$. The function in my code called \textbf{void insert(int w)} does this operation.

For output of the median 2k numbers, we need to pop all the k numbers in each heap and then put them back. the time compelixity is $O(4*k*lgN)$. The function in my code called \textbf{void outputMedian()} does this operation.

For deletion, it is similar to the output operation. The time compelixity is $O(4*k*lgN)$. The function in my code called \textbf{void deleteP(int p)} does this operation.
